# Implementation Plan: Loan-Analysis Landing Page

**Branch**: `001-loan-analysis-landing` | **Date**: 2026-05-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-loan-analysis-landing/spec.md`

## Summary

A single-page, Romanian-language marketing-and-intake site for a Moldovan microfinance contract-analysis service, plus a small set of supporting document pages linked from the footer. The page explains what the service does, who is accountable, how it is funded (free check + optional contingency-fee recovery), and what happens to an uploaded contract, then lets the borrower upload a contract to start a free automated check. Built in three shippable phases (credible core → recognition + outcomes → objections + off-ramps).

**Technical approach**: React + Vite + TypeScript with strictly CSS Modules and CSS custom-property design tokens (no utility frameworks). A plain client-side single-page app — React Router covers the landing page plus the footer document pages, and the upload widget is lazy-loaded. Old/low-end devices and constrained networks are out of scope, so no prerendering or performance gate is imposed; accessibility remains a hard requirement. i18n is structured from day one (Romanian at launch) so additional, native-reviewed languages can be added without restructuring. The contract-analysis backend is out of scope; the page integrates with it through a defined upload-intake contract.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, React 19, Node.js 20+ (build/test only; runtime output is static)
**Primary Dependencies**: Vite 6+, React Router, `i18next` + `react-i18next` (JSON resource catalogs). No CSS framework — CSS Modules + design tokens only. No CSS-in-JS.
**Storage**: None server-side from this page. Client-side: `localStorage` only for a language preference. The uploaded file is held in memory and POSTed to the external intake endpoint; never persisted by the page.
**Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library (unit/component), `vitest-axe`/`@axe-core` (accessibility), Playwright (e2e), plus content-lint scripts (tone, FAQ format, reading level, claims register).
**Target Platform**: Current evergreen browsers; mobile-first and responsive from ~360px up. Outdated browsers, old/low-end devices, and constrained networks are out of scope.
**Project Type**: Web — client-rendered React single-page app + supporting document routes; the upload widget is lazy-loaded.
**Performance Goals**: No enforced performance budget. Sensible defaults only — lazy-load the upload widget and keep dependencies minimal. (Old-device/slow-network targets are out of scope.)
**Constraints**: WCAG 2.2 AA; light-mode only; exactly one accent color; CSS Modules only; B1/grade-8 Romanian copy; honor `prefers-reduced-motion`; no third-party analytics/trackers or font CDNs by default (privacy-sensitive audience); Romanian text requires the `latin-ext` font subset (ș/ț comma-below diacritics).
**Scale/Scope**: One landing page (7 sections + footer) + ~6 supporting routes (sample report, about, data-handling, methodology, terms, accessibility). 1 language at launch, i18n-ready. Low traffic profile typical of a marketing-and-intake page.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is the unpopulated template — it contains only placeholders, so there are no ratified, project-specific principles to gate against. Default engineering principles are applied and all pass:

- **Simplicity / YAGNI**: No state manager, no CSS framework, no component library, no prerender/SSG layer. Dependencies are limited to routing and i18n. **PASS**
- **Accessibility-first**: WCAG 2.2 AA is a first-class requirement, enforced by `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` and axe in tests. **PASS**
- **Performance**: No enforced budget — old/low-end devices and constrained networks are out of scope per the updated requirements. The upload widget is lazy-loaded and dependencies kept minimal. **PASS**
- **No hidden behavior**: No trackers; the upload boundary is an explicit, documented contract. **PASS**

Complexity Tracking is empty (see below): with the performance constraint relaxed, no architectural workarounds are needed.

Re-check after Phase 1: design introduces no new violations. **PASS** (see end of Phase 1).

```

**Structure Decision**: Client-rendered React single-page app. Sections are self-contained component folders (component + scoped CSS Module) composed by `routes/Home.tsx` in the canonical order required by FR-001. `components/UploadWidget` is lazy-loaded. Footer-linked documents are real routes under `routes/`. All visual values flow from `styles/tokens.css`; CSS Modules consume them via `var(--token)`, enforcing the single-accent palette and the 12–20px radius / soft-shadow / no-hard-border rules in one place.

## Complexity Tracking

None. React + Vite is the user-selected stack; the performance tension noted in earlier drafts was removed when old-device and slow-network support were taken out of scope, so no prerendering layer or budget workaround is needed.
